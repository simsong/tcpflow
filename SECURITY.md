# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is not supported software. However, we try to accept pull requests on a regular basis. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities publicly using GitHub's Security reporting feature. 

We prefer vulnerability reports to be accompanied by:
- Proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability
- A unit test that fails because of the vulnerability
- A PR that fixes the vulnerability and makes the system pass the unit test.

Thanks!
