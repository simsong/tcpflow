.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B tcpflow
is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections
(flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol
analysis or debugging.  Rather than showing packet-by-packet information, tcpflow
reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
separate file for later analysis.  tcpflow understands TCP sequence
numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of
retransmissions or out-of-order delivery. tcpflow provides control over filenames
for automatic binning of connections by protocol, IP adress or connection number, and has a sophisticated
plug-in system for decompressing compressed HTTP connections, undoing MIME encoding, or calling user-provided
programs for post-processing.
.LP
By default tcpflow stores all captured data in files that have names of the form:
.in +.5i
.nf

\fB192.168.101.102.02345-010.011.012.013.45103\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
\,...where the contents of the above file would be data transmitted from
host 192.168.101.102 port 2345, to host 10.11.12.13 port 45103.
.LP
If you want to simply process a few hundred thousand packets and see what you have, try this:
.in +.5i
.nf

\fBtcpflow -a -o outdir -Fk -r packets.pcap\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
This will cause tcpflow to perform (-a) all processing, store the output in a directory
called 
.BI outdir,
bin the output in directories of 1000 connections each, and read its input from the file
\fBpackets.pcap\fP. More sophisticiated processing is possible, of course.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Enable all processing. Same as 
.B \-e all.
.TP
.B \-B
Force binary output even when printing to console with 
.B -C 
or 
.B -c.
.TP
.B \-b \fImax_bytes\fP
Specifies the maximum size of a captured flow.  Any bytes beyond \fImax_bytes\fP from the
first byte captured will be discarded.  The default is to store an
unlimited number of bytes per flow. \fBNote:\fP previous versions of \fBtcpflow\fP could only store
a maximum of 4GiB per flow, but version 1.4 and above can really store an unlimited amount 
of bytes.  Good thing that modern disks are so big, eh?
.TP
.B \-c
Console print.  Print the contents of packets to stdout as they
are received, without storing any captured data to files (implies
.TP
.B \-C
Console print without the packet source and destination details being printed.  Print the contents of packets to stdout as they
are received, without storing any captured data to files (implies
.B \-e
When outputting to the console each flow will be output in different colors
(blue for client to server flows, red for server to client flows, green for undecided flows).
.B -s
).
.TP
.B \-D
Console output should be in hex. 
.TP
.B \-d
Debug level.  Set the level of debugging messages printed to stderr to
\fIdebug_level\fP.  Higher numbers produce more messages.
.B \-d 0
causes completely silent operation.
.B \-d 1
, the default, produces minimal status messages.
.B \-d 10
produces verbose output equivalent to
.B \-v .
Numbers higher than 10 can produce a large
amount of debugging information useful only to developers.
.TP
.B \-E name
Disable all scanners and then enable scanner
.B name
.TP
.B \-e name
Enable scanner 
.B name.
.TP
.B \-e all
Enables all scanners. Same as 
.B \-a
.TP
.B \-e http
Perform HTTP post-processing ("After" processing). If the output file is
.in +.5i
.nf

\fB208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314,\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
Then the post-processing will create the files:
.in +.5i
.nf

\fB208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTP\fP
\fB208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTPBODY\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
If the HTTPBODY was compressed with GZIP, you may get a 
third file as well:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fB208.111.153.175.00080-192.168.001.064.37314-HTTPBODY-GZIP\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
Additional information about these streams, such as their MD5
hash value, is also written to the DFXML file
.TP
.B \-F[format]
Specifies format for output filenames. Format specifiers:
.B c
appends the connection counter to ALL filenames.
.B t
prepends each filename with a Unix timestamp.
.B T
prepends each filename with an ISO-8601 timestamp.
.B X
Do not output any files (other than the 
.B report.xml 
report files).
.TP
.B \-FM
Include MD5 of each flow in the DFXML output.
.TP
.B \-FX
Suppresses file output entirely (DFXML file is still produced).
.TP
.B \-Fk
bin output in 1K directories
.TP
.B \-Fm
bin output in 1M directories (2 levels)
.TP
.B \-Fg
bin output in 1G directories (3 levels)
.B \-T[format]
Specifies an arbitrary template for filenames. 
.B %A
expands to source IP address.
.B %a
expands to source IP port.
.B %B
expands to destination IP address.
.B %a
expands to destination IP port.
.B %T
expands to timestamp in ISO8601 format.
.B %t
expands to timestamp in Unix time_t format.
.B %V
expands to "--" if a VLAN is present.
.B %v
expands to the VLAN number if a VLAN is present.
.B %C
expands to "c" if the connection count>0.
.B %c
expands to the connection count if the connection count>0.
.B %#
always expands to the connection count.
.B %%
prints a "%".
.TP
.B \-f\fImax_fds\fP
Max file descriptors used.  Limit the number of file descriptors used
by tcpflow to \fImax_fds\fP.  Higher numbers use more system
resources, but usually perform better.  If the underlying operating
system supports the
.B setrlimit()
system call, the OS will be asked to enforce the requested limit.  The
default is for tcpflow to use the maximum number of file descriptors
allowed by the OS.  The
.B \-v
option will report how many file descriptors tcpflow is using.
.TP
.B \-h
Help.  Print usage information and exit.
.TP
.B \-hh
More help.  Print more usage information and exit.
.TP
.B \-i \fIiface\fP
Interface name.  Capture packets from the network interface
named \fIiface\fP.  If no interface is specified with
.B \-i
, a reasonable default will be used by libpcap automatically.
.TP
.B \-L \fIsemlock_name\fP
Specifies that \fIsemlock_name\fP should be used as a Unix semaphore to prevent two different copies
of tcpflow running in two different processes but outputing to the same standard output from printing 
on top of each other. This is an application of Unix named semaphores; bet you have never seen
one before.
.TP
.B \-l
Treat the following arguments as filenames with an assumed \fB-r\fP command before each one. 
This allows you to read a lot of files at once with shell globbing. For example, to process
all of the pcap files in the current directory, use this:
.in +.5i
.nf

\fBtcpflow -o out -a -l *.pcap\fP

.fi
.in -.5i
.TP
.B \-J
Output flow information to console in multiple colors. \fBNOTE: This option was changed from tcpflow 1.3.\fP
.TP
.B \-m \fImin_size\fP
Forces a new connection output file when there is a skip in the TCP session
of \fImin_size\fP bytes or more.
.TP
.B \-o \fIoutdir\fP
Specifies the output directory where the transcript files will be written.
.TP
.B \-P
No purge. Normally tcpflow removes connections from the hash table
after the connection is closed with a FIN. This conserves memory but
takes additional CPU time. Selecting this option causes the
std::tr1:unordered_map to grow without bounds, as tcpflow did prior to
version 1.1. That makes tcpflow run faster if there are less than 10
million connections, but can lead to out-of-memory errors.
.TP
.B \-p
No promiscuous mode.  Normally, tcpflow attempts to put the network
interface into promiscuous mode before capturing packets.  The
\fB-p\fP option tells tcpflow \fInot\fP to put the interface into
promiscuous mode.  Note that it might already be in promiscuous mode
for some other reason.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode --- don't print warnings. Currently the only warning that \fBtcpflow\fP
prints is a warning when more than 10,000 files are created that the user should
have provided the \fB-Fk\fP, \fB-Fm\fP, or \fB-Fg\fP options. We might have other warnings
in the future.
.TP
.B \-r
Read from file.  Read packets from \fIfile\fP, which was created using the
.B \-w
option of
.IR tcpdump (1).
This option may be repeated any number of times. Standard input is used if \fIfile\fP is "-".
Note that for this option to be useful, tcpdump's
.B \-s
option should be used to set the snaplen to the MTU of the interface
(e.g., 1500) while capturing packets.
.TP
.B \-R
Read from a file, but only to complete TCP flows. This option is used when 
.IR tcpflow
is used to process a series of files that are captured over time.
For each time period
\fIn,\fP file  \fIfilen.pcap\fP should be processed with  \fBR -r \fIfilen.pcap\fP,
while \fIfile(n-1).pcap\fP should be processed with \fIR -R file(n-1).pcap.\fP
.TP
.B \-S\fIname\fB=\fIvalue\fP
Sets a \fIname\fP parameter to be equal to \fIvalue\fP for a plug-in. 
Use \fB-hh\fP to find out all of the settable parameters.
.TP
.B \-s
Strip non-printables.  Convert all non-printable characters to the
"." character before printing packets to the console or storing them
to a file.
.TP
.B \-V
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose operation.  Verbosely describe tcpflow's operation.
Equivalent to \fB \-d 10\fP.
.TP
.B \-w \fIfilename.pcap\fP
Write packets that were not processed to \fIfilename.pcap\fP. Typically this will be 
UDP packets.
.TP
.B \-X \fIfilename.xml\fP
Write a DFXML report file to \fIfilename.xml\fP. The file contains a record of every 
tcp connection, how the tcpflow program was compiled, and the computer on which tcpflow was run.
.TP
.B \-Z
Don't decompress gzip-compressed streams. 
.\"START -- tcpdump excerpt"
.SH FILTERING EXPRESSIONS
The
.B expression
specified on the command-line specifies which packets should be
captured.  Because tcpflow uses the the libpcap library, tcpflow has
the same powerful filtering language available as programs such as
.IR tcpdump (1).
.LP
.B The following part of the man page is excerpted from the tcpdump man page.
.LP

\fIexpression\fP selects which packets will be dumped.  If no
\fIexpression\fP is given, all packets on the net will be dumped.
Otherwise, only packets for which \fIexpression\fP is `true' will be
dumped.
.LP
The \fIexpression\fP consists of one or more
.I primitives.
Primitives usually consist of an
.I id
(name or number) preceded by one or more qualifiers.  There are three
different kinds of qualifier:
.IP \fItype\fP
qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.
Possible types are
.BR host ,
.B net
and
.BR port .
E.g., `host foo', `net 128.3', `port 20'.  If there is no type
qualifier,
.B host
is assumed.
.IP \fIdir\fP
qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from
.I id.
Possible directions are
.BR src ,
.BR dst ,
.B "src or dst"
and
.B "src and"
.BR dst .
E.g., `src foo', `dst net 128.3', `src or dst port ftp-data'.  If
there is no dir qualifier,
.B "src or dst"
is assumed.
For `null' link layers (i.e. point to point protocols such as slip) the
.B inbound
and
.B outbound
qualifiers can be used to specify a desired direction.
.IP \fIproto\fP
qualifiers restrict the match to a particular protocol.  Possible
protos are:
.BR ether ,
.BR fddi ,
.BR ip ,
.BR arp ,
.BR rarp ,
.BR decnet ,
.BR lat ,
.BR sca ,
.BR moprc ,
.BR mopdl ,
.B tcp
and
.BR udp .
E.g., `ether src foo', `arp net 128.3', `tcp port 21'.  If there is
no proto qualifier, all protocols consistent with the type are
assumed.  E.g., `src foo' means `(ip or arp or rarp) src foo'
(except the latter is not legal syntax), `net bar' means `(ip or
arp or rarp) net bar' and `port 53' means `(tcp or udp) port 53'.
.LP
[`fddi' is actually an alias for `ether'; the parser treats them
identically as meaning ``the data link level used on the specified
network interface.''  FDDI headers contain Ethernet-like source
and destination addresses, and often contain Ethernet-like packet
types, so you can filter on these FDDI fields just as with the
analogous Ethernet fields.  FDDI headers also contain other fields,
but you cannot name them explicitly in a filter expression.]
.LP
In addition to the above, there are some special `primitive' keywords
that don't follow the pattern:
.BR gateway ,
.BR broadcast ,
.BR less ,
.B greater
and arithmetic expressions.  All of these are described below.
.LP
More complex filter expressions are built up by using the words
.BR and ,
.B or
and
.B not
to combine primitives.  E.g., `host foo and not port ftp and not port ftp-data'.
To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.  E.g.,
`tcp dst port ftp or ftp-data or domain' is exactly the same as
`tcp dst port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain'.
.LP
Allowable primitives are:
.IP "\fBdst host \fIhost\fR"
True if the IP destination field of the packet is \fIhost\fP,
which may be either an address or a name.
.IP "\fBsrc host \fIhost\fR"
True if the IP source field of the packet is \fIhost\fP.
.IP "\fBhost \fIhost\fP"
True if either the IP source or destination of the packet is \fIhost\fP.
Any of the above host expressions can be prepended with the keywords,
\fBip\fP, \fBarp\fP, or \fBrarp\fP as in:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether proto \fI\\ip\fB and host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
If \fIhost\fR is a name with multiple IP addresses, each address will
be checked for a match.
.IP "\fBether dst \fIehost\fP"
True if the ethernet destination address is \fIehost\fP.  \fIEhost\fP
may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a number (see
.IR ethers (3N)
for numeric format).
.IP "\fBether src \fIehost\fP"
True if the ethernet source address is \fIehost\fP.
.IP "\fBether host \fIehost\fP"
True if either the ethernet source or destination address is \fIehost\fP.
.IP "\fBgateway\fP \fIhost\fP"
True if the packet used \fIhost\fP as a gateway.  I.e., the ethernet
source or destination address was \fIhost\fP but neither the IP source
nor the IP destination was \fIhost\fP.  \fIHost\fP must be a name and
must be found in both /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers.  (An equivalent
expression is
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether host \fIehost \fBand not host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which can be used with either names or numbers for \fIhost / ehost\fP.)
.IP "\fBdst net \fInet\fR"
True if the IP destination address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP. \fINet\fP may be either a name from /etc/networks
or a network number (see \fInetworks(5)\fP for details).
.IP "\fBsrc net \fInet\fR"
True if the IP source address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR"
True if either the IP source or destination address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR \fBmask \fImask\fR"
True if the IP address matches \fInet\fR with the specific netmask.
May be qualified with \fBsrc\fR or \fBdst\fR.
.IP "\fBnet \fInet\fR/\fIlen\fR"
True if the IP address matches \fInet\fR a netmask \fIlen\fR bits wide.
May be qualified with \fBsrc\fR or \fBdst\fR.
.IP "\fBdst port \fIport\fR"
True if the packet is ip/tcp or ip/udp and has a
destination port value of \fIport\fP.
The \fIport\fP can be a number or a name used in /etc/services (see
.IR tcp (4P)
and
.IR udp (4P)).
If a name is used, both the port
number and protocol are checked.  If a number or ambiguous name is used,
only the port number is checked (e.g., \fBdst port 513\fR will print both
tcp/login traffic and udp/who traffic, and \fBport domain\fR will print
both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).
.IP "\fBsrc port \fIport\fR"
True if the packet has a source port value of \fIport\fP.
.IP "\fBport \fIport\fR"
True if either the source or destination port of the packet is \fIport\fP.
Any of the above port expressions can be prepended with the keywords,
\fBtcp\fP or \fBudp\fP, as in:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBtcp src port \fIport\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which matches only tcp packets whose source port is \fIport\fP.
.IP "\fBless \fIlength\fR"
True if the packet has a length less than or equal to \fIlength\fP.
This is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBlen <= \fIlength\fP.
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBgreater \fIlength\fR"
True if the packet has a length greater than or equal to \fIlength\fP.
This is equivalent to:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBlen >= \fIlength\fP.
.fi
.in -.5i
.IP "\fBip proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is an ip packet (see
.IR ip (4P))
of protocol type \fIprotocol\fP.
\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or one of the names
\fIicmp\fP, \fIigrp\fP, \fIudp\fP, \fInd\fP, or \fItcp\fP.
Note that the identifiers \fItcp\fP, \fIudp\fP, and \fIicmp\fP are also
keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\\), which is \\\\ in the C-shell.
.IP "\fBether broadcast\fR"
True if the packet is an ethernet broadcast packet.  The \fIether\fP
keyword is optional.
.IP "\fBip broadcast\fR"
True if the packet is an IP broadcast packet.  It checks for both
the all-zeroes and all-ones broadcast conventions, and looks up
the local subnet mask.
.IP "\fBether multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an ethernet multicast packet.  The \fIether\fP
keyword is optional.
This is shorthand for `\fBether[0] & 1 != 0\fP'.
.IP "\fBip multicast\fR"
True if the packet is an IP multicast packet.
.IP  "\fBether proto \fIprotocol\fR"
True if the packet is of ether type \fIprotocol\fR.
\fIProtocol\fP can be a number or a name like
\fIip\fP, \fIarp\fP, or \fIrarp\fP.
Note these identifiers are also keywords
and must be escaped via backslash (\\).
[In the case of FDDI (e.g., `\fBfddi protocol arp\fR'), the
protocol identification comes from the 802.2 Logical Link Control
(LLC) header, which is usually layered on top of the FDDI header.
\fITcpdump\fP assumes, when filtering on the protocol identifier,
that all FDDI packets include an LLC header, and that the LLC header
is in so-called SNAP format.]
.IP "\fBdecnet src \fIhost\fR"
True if the DECNET source address is
.IR host ,
which may be an address of the form ``10.123'', or a DECNET host
name.  [DECNET host name support is only available on Ultrix systems
that are configured to run DECNET.]
.IP "\fBdecnet dst \fIhost\fR"
True if the DECNET destination address is
.IR host .
.IP "\fBdecnet host \fIhost\fR"
True if either the DECNET source or destination address is
.IR host .
.IP "\fBip\fR, \fBarp\fR, \fBrarp\fR, \fBdecnet\fR"
Abbreviations for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether proto \fIp\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
where \fIp\fR is one of the above protocols.
.IP "\fBlat\fR, \fBmoprc\fR, \fBmopdl\fR"
Abbreviations for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether proto \fIp\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
where \fIp\fR is one of the above protocols.
Note that
\fItcpdump\fP does not currently know how to parse these protocols.
.IP  "\fBtcp\fR, \fBudp\fR, \fBicmp\fR"
Abbreviations for:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBip proto \fIp\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
where \fIp\fR is one of the above protocols.
.IP  "\fIexpr relop expr\fR"
True if the relation holds, where \fIrelop\fR is one of >, <, >=, <=, =, !=,
and \fIexpr\fR is an arithmetic expression composed of integer constants
(expressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary operators
[+, -, *, /, &, |], a length operator, and special packet data accessors.
To access
data inside the packet, use the following syntax:
.in +.5i
.nf
\fIproto\fB [ \fIexpr\fB : \fIsize\fB ]\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
\fIProto\fR is one of \fBether, fddi,
ip, arp, rarp, tcp, udp, \fRor \fBicmp\fR, and
indicates the protocol layer for the index operation.
The byte offset, relative to the indicated protocol layer, is
given by \fIexpr\fR.
\fISize\fR is optional and indicates the number of bytes in the
field of interest; it can be either one, two, or four, and defaults to one.
The length operator, indicated by the keyword \fBlen\fP, gives the
length of the packet.

For example, `\fBether[0] & 1 != 0\fP' catches all multicast traffic.
The expression `\fBip[0] & 0xf != 5\fP'
catches all IP packets with options. The expression
`\fBip[6:2] & 0x1fff = 0\fP'
catches only unfragmented datagrams and frag zero of fragmented datagrams.
This check is implicitly applied to the \fBtcp\fP and \fBudp\fP
index operations.
For instance, \fBtcp[0]\fP always means the first
byte of the TCP \fIheader\fP, and never means the first byte of an
intervening fragment.
.LP
Primitives may be combined using:
.IP
A parenthesized group of primitives and operators
(parentheses are special to the Shell and must be escaped).
.IP
Negation (`\fB!\fP' or `\fBnot\fP').
.IP
Concatenation (`\fB&&\fP' or `\fBand\fP').
.IP
Alternation (`\fB||\fP' or `\fBor\fP').
.LP
Negation has highest precedence.
Alternation and concatenation have equal precedence and associate
left to right.  Note that explicit \fBand\fR tokens, not juxtaposition,
are now required for concatenation.
.LP
If an identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent keyword
is assumed.
For example,
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot host vs and ace\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
is short for
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot host vs and host ace\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which should not be confused with
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBnot ( host vs or ace )\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
.LP
Expression arguments can be passed to tcpdump as either a single argument
or as multiple arguments, whichever is more convenient.
Generally, if the expression contains Shell metacharacters, it is
easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument.
Multiple arguments are concatenated with spaces before being parsed.

.SH BUGS
Please send bug reports to simsong@acm.org.
.LP
tcpflow currently does not understand IP fragments.  Flows containing
IP fragments will not be recorded correctly.
.LP
tcpflow never frees state associated with flows that it records, so
will grow large if used to capture a very large number of flows (e.g.,
on the order of 100,000 flows or more).
.LP
There appears to be a bug in the way that Linux delivers packets to
libpcap when using the loopback interface ("localhost").  When
listening to the Linux loopback interface, selective packet filtering
is not possible; all TCP flows on the localhost interface will be
recorded.
